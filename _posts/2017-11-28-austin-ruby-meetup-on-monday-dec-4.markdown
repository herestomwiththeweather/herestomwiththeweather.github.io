I will be presenting [Jekyll-Indieweb and Friends](https://www.meetup.com/austinrb/events/245027719/) at the austin.rb meetup at Capital Factory on Monday Dec. 4 at 7pm.

The following weekend, also at Capital Factory, is the first [Indiewebcamp Austin](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/indiewebcamp-austin-2017-tickets-39918084064) and the [EFF-Austin holiday party](https://www.meetup.com/EFF-Austin/events/245317381/) will be Saturday evening.

Hope to see you there!
