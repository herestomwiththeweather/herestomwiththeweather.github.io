Two weeks ago, I attended a day of sessions at IETF92 in Dallas. At the [newcomer’s orientation](https://youtu.be/Sxg-Xi6c7VU), the IETF’s practice of measuring rough consensus with humming rather than a show of hands was covered. [Scott Bradner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Bradner) explained that this accommodates the contigency of an employee of a company wanting to comfortably express preference for a view inconsistent with the view of the employee’s boss (an example of where anonymity is important). This assumes that there is enough people in the room to stay anonymous. However, I noticed that for trivial or non-controversial issues, a show of hands was used.


The remote participation tools for IETF are impressive and it was cool to see this in action. The media archives of past events is also a great resource. Here is the [media for the OAuth session](http://www.ietf.org/proceedings/92/oauth.html) I attended.
