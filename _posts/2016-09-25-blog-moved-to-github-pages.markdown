I just moved my jekyll blog from my rackspace server to github pages to see if I can automate sending [webmentions](https://indieweb.org/webmention)  without using code on my own server and let [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) do that for me.  The problem with my previous setup is that although it worked for me, the setup was not particularly easy and I would prefer using a setup I can recommend to others considering jekyll as an indieweb blogging tool.  

The downside is that github pages [does not seem to offer https for custom domains](https://help.github.com/articles/securing-your-github-pages-site-with-https/).
