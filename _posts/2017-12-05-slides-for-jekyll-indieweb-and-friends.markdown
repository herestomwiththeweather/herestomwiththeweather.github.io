I enjoyed presenting [Jekyll-Indieweb and Friends](https://jekyll-indieweb-and-friends.herokuapp.com/) at [AustinRB](https://www.meetup.com/austinrb/) last night.

During my talk, there was a moment of my own confusion as I tried to like a post within the excellent [woodwind.xyz](https://woodwind.xyz/) indieweb reader as I wanted to show that the like would show up on the target post.  However, only later did I realize it was a repost which explains why the like didn't show up on the reposter's site.

Thanks to [Youssef Chaker](http://youhoo.im/) and [Nola Stowe](http://blog.rubygeek.com/) for the opportunity to present.
