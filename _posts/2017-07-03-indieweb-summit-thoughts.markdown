I am very glad I attended [Indieweb Summit 2017](https://2017.indieweb.org/) in Portland.  Since I learned a lot at last year's event, I decided to make the trip again.  The general format was the same: unscheduled sessions on Saturday and small projects on Sunday.  Prior to the sessions, there were introductions and some scheduled talks including a neat [indiemap project](https://snarfed.org/2017-06-24_new-side-project-indie-map).  I found it interesting that a significant percentage of indieweb sites include a [rel-me](http://indieweb.org/rel-me) link to a personal [keybase.io](https://keybase.io) page.

In the [Specialized Micropub Clients](http://indieweb.org/2017/specialmicropub) session, I learned about [webpage-micropub-to-github](https://github.com/voxpelli/webpage-micropub-to-github/) which enables people like myself who use the static-site-generator [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to make posts from any micropub compatible client.  It accepts a micropub request from a client like [quill](https://quill.p3k.io/) and turns that into a git commit including the yaml front matter and content to a jekyll static site.  This capability was [developed by Pelle Wessman - voxpelli](https://voxpelli.com/2016/03/my-2015-in-indieweb/).  It was a no-brainer for me that I needed to [set this up on Sunday for my small project](https://indieweb.org/2017/Demos#Tom_Brown).  It was great to be able to make a post without using git and, using quill, I could even pass my location of where I was posting from and [include a map in the footer of my post](https://github.com/herestomwiththeweather/herestomwiththeweather.github.io/commit/8abbb4f693077de71f0925677d2a4b0b9da380c5).

Afterwards, there was a fun meetup at a karaoke bar!  Thanks to [Tantek](http://tantek.com/) and [Aaron](https://aaronparecki.com/) and [sponsors](http://indieweb.org/2017/#Sponsors) for another great Indieweb Summit!
