Today we learned that [a 34 year old hockey player](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Toews), a 6x all-star in the NHL's list of 100 greatest players of all time, [stopped playing hockey several weeks ago due to Long Covid](https://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/nhl/jonathan-toews-nhl-roundup-feb19-1.6753912).

The covid minimizer that now owns [Twitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter) intentionally allows misinformation to spread. [Mask up](https://www.staples.com/3m-aura-n95-particulate-respirator-white-20-pack-9205p-20-dc/product_24503827).
