Jodie Ginsberg, CPJ’s chief executive officer:

> No journalist from outside Gaza has been allowed in since the start of that war, and that’s highly unusual. I speak to lots of war correspondents who’s covered many, many wars over decades, and all of them talk about how unprecedented this is to not have any access whatsoever. And that, of course, puts additional pressure on these journalists.

In the interview, Amy Goodman also mentions "[James McGovern leading 64 other congressmembers in a letter to Biden and Blinken](https://mcgovern.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=400123), urging them to push for Israel to allow in international journalists"
