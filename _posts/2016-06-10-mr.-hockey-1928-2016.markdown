[![Gordie Howe](http://i.cbc.ca/1.3629700.1465597416!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/howe-and-gretzky.jpg)](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/wayne-gretzky-recalls-his-friendship-with-gordie-howe-the-greatest-to-ever-play-the-game-1.3629087)

I narrowly missed watching Howe play and win championships for the Houston Aeros as my family moved back to Houston just after he left for the Hartford Whalers. It was truly amazing that a 50 year old man could still competitively play professional hockey. Jaromír Jágr is the closest but he's only 44.

I was fortunate to see several Aeros games after Howe's departure and I especially liked tweets from former Houston Aero Cam Connor today reminiscing about Gordie's [toughness on the ice](https://twitter.com/CamConnorNHL/status/741291384162811904) but also [kindness](https://twitter.com/CamConnorNHL/status/741318013463363584). Gretzky is right that Howe was [the greatest](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/wayne-gretzky-recalls-his-friendship-with-gordie-howe-the-greatest-to-ever-play-the-game-1.3629087).

Rest in Peace, Mr. Hockey.
