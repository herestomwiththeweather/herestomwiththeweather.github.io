A week ago, [I made a post](https://herestomwiththeweather.com/2023/10/26/orwellian-language/) about the bizarre use of the phrase "right to self-defense" and today [Ta-Nehisi Coates addressed this phrase](https://www.democracynow.org/2023/11/2/ta_nehisi_coates).

> I keep hearing this term repeated over and over again: “the right to self-defense.” What about the right to dignity? What about the right to morality? What about the right to be able to sleep at night? Because what I know is, if I was complicit — and I am complicit — in dropping bombs on children, in dropping bombs on refugee camps, no matter who’s there, it would give me trouble sleeping at night. And I worry for the souls of people who can do this and can sleep at night.
