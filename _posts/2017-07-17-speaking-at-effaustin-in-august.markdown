On Monday August 14, I will be at [Capital Factory](https://capitalfactory.com/) for the [EFFAustin](http://effaustin.org/) monthly meeting to show off some of the Indieweb software I learned about at the [Indieweb Summit](https://2017.indieweb.org/).  Please [RSVP](https://www.meetup.com/EFF-Austin/events/241601607/) if you can attend!

[A Brief History of my Website](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VGX8iBWrTE&list=PLk3TtIJ31hqrLIPqz55TczawWu-30cnXM&index=4) at the Summit was a nice introduction to the capabilities of the Indieweb.
