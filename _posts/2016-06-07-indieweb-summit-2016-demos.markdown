Wow! I had a great time at the [Indieweb Summit](http://2016.indieweb.org/) and was very impressed with the current work.  The first day (Saturday) was barcamp-style sessions and the second day was project day with [demos](http://indiewebcamp.com/2016/Demos).

I worked on a modest project of automating sending my webmentions with a post-receive hook to my git server. The code I wrote is available [here](https://gist.github.com/herestomwiththeweather/c1ec89cb22f6d97feed963b4b32309e3) and [here](https://gist.github.com/herestomwiththeweather/f73dec9fdaa2ed0821594192f4a93cfd). I plan to write up some more detail later.  Thanks to [Tantek](http://tantek.com/), [Aaron](https://aaronparecki.com/), [Shane](https://aaronparecki.com/) and everyone for a great experience!
