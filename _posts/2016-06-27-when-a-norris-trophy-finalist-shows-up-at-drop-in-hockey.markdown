Drop-in hockey is always a lot of fun but today it was crazy because seemingly out of nowhere, this player who looks like [Brent Burns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brent_Burns) shows up at the last minute.  After watching him skate for a few seconds, it was clear that this was the real deal.  

Shortly into my first shift, someone on the other team hit the puck into center ice and I had the opportunity to retrieve it.  I saw Burns was the closest opposing player to the puck and yet somehow the thought "I got this" actually went through my head.  Since I had my back to the puck, I circled around but by the time I made eye-contact with the puck, Burns was already on his way to an easy score.

He was genuinely friendly afterwards and even said thanks for having him there (any time!) and several of us took a picture with him.  He [tweeted](https://twitter.com/Burnzie88/status/747572135267184640) about the visit.
