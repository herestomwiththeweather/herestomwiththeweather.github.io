This week I found out Rick Simon died.  I was fortunate to collaborate with him on open source work and a hackathon and was always impressed with his rare ability to be a positive force for change.  Above is a picture of Rick presenting at the end of a hackathon.  There is an [event this weekend](https://www.meetup.com/Bay-Area-Community-Exchange-Timebank/events/247605291/) in memory of Rick in San Francisco.  Another good man has left us.
