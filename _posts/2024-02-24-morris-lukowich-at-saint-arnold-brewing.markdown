Today I was fortunate to have my picture taken with [Morris Lukowich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_Lukowich) during [Hockey Day in Houston](https://www.houstonpress.com/event/hockey-day-in-houston-17291274) at [Saint Arnold Brewing](https://www.saintarnold.com/).  The best hockey games I have ever watched in-person were the [1977-78 Houston Aeros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1977%E2%80%9378_Houston_Aeros_season).  The WHA All-Star game was in Quebec City on January 17, 1978 and for the picture I believe it is Lukowich's All-Star jersey from that game that I have borrowed.
