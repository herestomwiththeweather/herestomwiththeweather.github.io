With [guidance from Chris Aldrich](https://boffosocko.com/2018/08/18/a-reply-to-david-shanske-regarding-implementation-of-the-diso-project/#comment-71576), I confirmed that the [dshanske/twentysixteen-indieweb](https://github.com/dshanske/twentysixteen-indieweb) works great with webmentions on the [EFF-Austin](https://effaustin.org) site.  Thanks once again to [David Shanske](https://david.shanske.com/).
