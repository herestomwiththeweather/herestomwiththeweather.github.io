Lisa Pease's [A Lie Too Big to Fail](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39719468-a-lie-too-big-to-fail) was educational in many ways.  Because she is so familiar with the evidence, she can amazingly tame it into a coherent story.  It reminds me of the persistence of the people featured in the documentary [Fast, Cheap and Out of Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast,_Cheap_%26_Out_of_Control).  I had trouble following the bullet forensics material and there seems to be an obligation in a book like this to do some educated guesswork at the conclusion.  But the rest of the book was easy to digest and made me more curious about these unfortunate events and I started relating the treatment of witnesses to the [Asch experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asch_conformity_experiments) and Sirhan's situation to the [Kobayashi Maru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobayashi_Maru).  It took me a while to realize how appropriate the title is.
