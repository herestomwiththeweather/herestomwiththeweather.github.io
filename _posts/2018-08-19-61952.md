At 13:20 in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo29yq7d4is">IndieWeb with Wordpress Tutorial: Themes and Microformats</a>, the <a href="https://indieweb.org/WordPress/Themes">indieweb wordpress themes wiki page</a> is referenced and a fork of the twentysixteen wordpress theme is mentioned.  Is that theme the same as <a href="https://github.com/chrisaldrich/2016-child-theme-for-indieweb">this 2016-child-theme-for-indieweb github repo</a> and is it meant to be used with the mf2 wordpress plugin?
