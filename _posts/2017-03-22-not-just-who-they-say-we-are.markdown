<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/207961532">Not Just Who They Say We Are</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/windley">Phil Windley</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>

[Heather Vescent](http://www.heathervescent.com/heathervescent/biography.html) produced this film about the [Internet Identity Workshop](http://www.internetidentityworkshop.com/).  There are so many people over the years at IIW that have shared insights that I have been able to apply in my work related to digital identity.  Even at the dinners, someone will tell a story or recommend a book that has changed the way I think about what is possible.  My contribution to this film is actually an insight about privacy borrowed from Bruce Schneier who I was lucky to see speak in Austin three years ago.
