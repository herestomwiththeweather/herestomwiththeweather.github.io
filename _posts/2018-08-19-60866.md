At 13:20 in the youtube video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo29yq7d4is">IndieWeb with Wordpress Tutorial: Themes and Microformats</a>, the <a href="https://indieweb.org/WordPress/Themes">indieweb wordpress themes wiki page</a> is referenced and also a fork of the twentysixteen wordpress theme (which nicely displays mentions!) is noted as the one on <a href="https://boffosocko.com">boffosocko.com</a>. Is that theme the same as <a href="https://github.com/chrisaldrich/twentysixteen">this twentysixteen github repo</a> and does it also require use of the mf2 wordpress plugin?
