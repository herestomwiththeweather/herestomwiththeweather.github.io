My blog is now linking to [openlibrary.org](https://openlibrary.org) for [read posts](https://indieweb.org/read). If you have the book's ISBN, then it is trivial to link to openlibrary's page for your book.  It would be cool if those pages accepted webmention so that you could see who is reading the book.
