I'm about to leave Kentucky after a pretty cool week here.  The highlight for me were three nights staying in a cabin made from a shipping container near Slade while visiting the Red River Gorge. It was really nice to be disconnected for a while and there was a Kroger in nearby Stanton to pick up all the ingredients for a good white chilli.  The Kentucky Historical Society library and the Old State Capitol tour in Frankfort were also good.  Besides my own cooking, the best food was the barbeque at Fred's Smokehouse at the Jim Beam distillery and some derby pie and ice cream in Louisville.
