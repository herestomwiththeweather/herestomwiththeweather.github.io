I was glad to find this helpful [summary](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1668685034943815701.html) by [Erin C. Sanders](https://erinsandersnp.org/) of the paper [SARS-CoV-2 infection and viral fusogens cause neuronal and glial fusion that compromises neuronal activity](https://www.science.org/doi/epdf/10.1126/sciadv.adg2248) that investigates possible processes that covid uses to impair brain function.

My understanding that these experiments show that a vaccination would not be able to cause this which should not be a surprise.
