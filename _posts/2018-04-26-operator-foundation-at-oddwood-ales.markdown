I enjoyed hanging out tonight with some cool people at [Oddwood Ales](https://www.oddwoodales.com/home).  Among them were members of the nonprofit [Operator Foundation](https://operatorfoundation.org/).  I learned about prototypes shown above which use the [LoRa](https://www.semtech.com/technology/lora/what-is-lora) protocol as an alternative (low-bandwidth) way to gain access to the Internet.
