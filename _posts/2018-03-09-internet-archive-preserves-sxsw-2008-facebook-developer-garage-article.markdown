Austin's first Facebook Developer Garage was 10 years ago at SXSW Interactive and Gawker article [Mark Zuckerberg Developer Q&A](https://web.archive.org/web/20090204213033/http://valleywag.gawker.com/366123/mark-zuckerberg-developer-qa-at-sxsw) provided a recap of the event including Zuckerberg revealing that "we're not openly working with governments" (nudge nudge wink wink) in the context of user privacy.

Update: Oh, I just realized the url for the gawker article was changed and is now available [here](http://gawker.com/366123/mark-zuckerberg-developer-qa-at-sxsw).  In any case, the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/) was the resource that helped me find it.
