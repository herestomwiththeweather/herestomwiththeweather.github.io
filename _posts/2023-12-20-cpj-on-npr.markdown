Yesterday, NPR published a 4-minute interview [Number of journalists killed in Gaza since Oct. 7 attacks called unprecedented loss](https://www.npr.org/2023/12/19/1220210900/number-of-journalists-killed-in-gaza-since-oct-7-attacks-called-unprecedented-lo) with the president of the nonprofit [Committee to Protect Journalists](https://cpj.org).  CPJ maintains a list at [Journalist casualties in the Israel-Gaza war](https://cpj.org/2023/12/journalist-casualties-in-the-israel-gaza-conflict/).

Until this unprecedented threat to journalists is mitigated, I would expect to continue to hear a whole lot of nonsense.
