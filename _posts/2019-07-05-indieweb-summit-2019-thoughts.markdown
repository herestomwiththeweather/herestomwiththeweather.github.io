Thanks to [Aaron Parecki](https://aaronparecki.com), the [Indieweb Summit 2019 videos have been posted to the Internet Archive](https://indieweb.org/2019/Schedule) which includes the day 1 keynotes, intros and sessions and the day 2 sessions and [demos](https://indieweb.org/2019/Demos).

I really enjoyed the teamwork of the [Possible Futures](https://indieweb.org/2019/indiewebfutures) session as we broke out into 4 groups and our group had the opportunity to discuss surveillance capitalism.  I also enjoyed talking with [Johannes Ernst](https://upon2020.com/blog) about the latest plans for [UBOSbox](https://indieweb.org/UBOSbox).  I also attended the [AutoAuth](https://indieweb.org/2019/alltheauth) session but private posts, although important, don't seem like a natural fit with Indieweb building blocks to me.  I could be wrong.  After day 1, some of us attended [Dat night](https://datnight.org/) which was great.

There were a lot of good day 2 [demos](https://indieweb.org/2019/Demos).  Displaying a live list of sites you subscribe to with your reader which was done by [Jonathan Lacour](https://cleverdevil.io/) looked great.  For my demo, I made this site available on the Dat network which you can access with Beaker browser at *dat://herestomwiththeweather.com*.  I have installed a [Dat service](https://docs.datproject.org/docs/dat-server) on my rackspace server which is always available.

Indieweb Summit was really well organized and I mentioned some of what I considered improvements to [Manton Reece](https://manton.org) at Austin Homebrew Website Club this week for consideration at the next IndiewebCamp Austin.
