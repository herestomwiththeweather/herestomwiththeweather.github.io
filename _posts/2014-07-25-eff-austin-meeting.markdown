Thanks to Stephen Torrence for [recording the EFF-Austin meeting](http://effaustin.org/2014/07/21st-century-virtual-identity-a-recording). Some of the toughest questions raised after the presentation regarded digital death and Stephen [included some relevant links](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8U7_a_inWak) with the recording. Lots to think about!
