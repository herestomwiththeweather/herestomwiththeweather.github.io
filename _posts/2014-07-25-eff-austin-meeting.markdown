Thanks to Stephen Torrence for [recording the EFF-Austin meeting](http://effaustin.org/2014/07/21st-century-virtual-identity-a-recording). Some of the toughest questions raised after the presentation regarded digital death and Stephen [included some relevant links](https://soundcloud.com/stephen-torrence/eff-austin-july-meetup-2014) with the recording. Lots to think about!
