I was glad to hear this week that [Texas A&M](https://www.tamuicehockey.com/) and [Houston](https://www.houstonicehockey.com/) will finally be playing each other [on September 12](https://www.houstonicehockey.com/games/game-vs-texas-am-university-on-09122025-m8etlv4u/tickets) at [Sugarland Ice Center](https://www.sugarlandice.com). I attended UofH's first game in 80 years [2 years ago](https://mastodon.social/@herestomwiththeweather/111016234563990106) and they've done a great job building up the team since then and I expect them to be competitive for the first game of the season.
