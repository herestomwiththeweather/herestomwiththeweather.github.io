This thing is great.  With the help of this video, the [UBOSbox](https://indiecomputing.com/) was easy to put together.  After that, you follow some instructions on how to use the usb stick to boot up the system with [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) for the first time.

So far, I have been using the [NextCloud android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nextcloud.client) to sync photos from my mobile device to my UBOSbox.  For now, I'm not yet giving my UBOSbox a public web address but I'm keeping in mind that there's lots of potential as there are many open source apps like [wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) to choose from.  You can [make a request](https://github.com/uboslinux/apps-wanted/issues) to add support for an app as well.  And as [Eben Moglen](http://moglen.law.columbia.edu/) would say, I get to own and keep my logs.
