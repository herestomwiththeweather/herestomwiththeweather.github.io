As I just registered for a new season of beer league hockey starting this weekend, I thought about an episode of [C'est comme Ã§a que je t'aime](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%27est_comme_%C3%A7a_que_je_t%27aime_(s%C3%A9rie_t%C3%A9l%C3%A9vis%C3%A9e)) I recently watched which is set in 1974 [Sainte-Foy, Quebec City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sainte-Foy,_Quebec_City).  Nearly all the 1974 Quebec cultural references are new to me and in this episode, there is an adventure in a hockey arena and you can pause the video in a few places and see signage in the background for a junior hockey team called [Ste. Foy Couillard](https://www.hockeydb.com/stte/ste.-foy-couillard-10999.html) that only existed from 1972-1974.

You can watch it at [ICI Tou.tv](https://ici.tou.tv/c-est-comme-ca-que-je-t-aime) (in Canada) or [Amazon Prime](https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B0CXRS7C6S/ref=atv_dp_share_cu_r) (in U.S.).
