Both [Vaccines may not prevent many symptoms of long covid, study suggests](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2022/05/25/long-covid-vaccines-slight-protection/) and [1 Of 5 With Covid May Develop Long Covid, CDC Finds](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2022/05/25/long-covid-vaccines-slight-protection/) were also persuasive.
