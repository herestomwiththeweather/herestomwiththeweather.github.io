Earlier this week, I signed up for [RubyConf 2022](https://rubyconf.org/) which is Nov. 29 - Dec. 1 in Houston.  This is my first conference since the pandemic started and I was glad to see the [safety precautions](https://rubyconf.org/safety).  The [schedule](https://rubyconf.org/schedule) also looks great!  Please say "Hi!" if you see me there.
