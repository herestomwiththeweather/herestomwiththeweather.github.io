Johannes Ernst uses a [neat trick](https://reb00ted.org/society/20200314-pandemonium-at-trader-joes/) to estimate the missing data:

> To compare, Santa Clara County (about 1.8 million people) [today reports on its website](https://www.sccgov.org/sites/phd/DiseaseInformation/novel-coronavirus/Pages/home.aspx) 79 Coronavirus cases, of which 36 are hospitalized. Accounting for the disaster that is testing in the US, other countries have about 10% of known cases hospitalized, so that would lead to about 360 known cases if testing had been done properly.
