[“Extermination & Acts of Genocide”: Human Rights Watch on Israel Deliberately Depriving Gaza of Water](https://www.democracynow.org/2024/12/19/hrw_gaza_genocide_water_deprivation)

__AMY GOODMAN__: So, can I ask you, Bill Van Esveld, is this the first time that Human Rights Watch is accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza?

__BILL VAN ESVELD__: This is the first time that we’ve made a finding of genocidal acts in Gaza. It is not an accusation that we level lightly. We have not done this very often in our history. We accused the Myanmar military of genocidal acts against the Rohingya in 2017, and we found full-blown genocide against the Kurds in Saddam Hussein’s Anfal campaign in Iraq in the '80s — sorry, in the ’90s, and we found genocide against — also in Rwanda in the ’80s. It is, you know, an extremely difficult crime to prove. It is, you know, mass killing deliberately to destroy people because they're part of the group, not something we level lightly, but, yes, we found it here.
