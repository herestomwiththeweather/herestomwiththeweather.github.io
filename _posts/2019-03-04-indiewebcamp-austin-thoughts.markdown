As expected, the day one [schedule](https://indieweb.org/2019/Austin/Schedule) for [IndiewebCamp Austin](https://indieweb.org/2019/Austin) included a variety of cool sessions like [p2p websites with Dat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpA1gWL2fok) with [Beaker Browser](https://beakerbrowser.com/) which allows you to easily create and share content without having to worry about server-side hosting and for those who like to worry about server-side hosting, there was [Web Hosting and Migration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrgzvetbH7o).

On project day, I investigated two hosting providers for wordpress for the purpose of integrating with an [indieweb reader](https://indieweb.org/reader).  It was great that [Aaron Parecki](https://aaronparecki.com/) and [David Shanske](https://david.shanske.com/) were around to help.  As a Jekyll user, I don't really have any skin in the game as far as needing a wordpress solution but it was a good learning exercise and I hope to document something soon.

It was also great seeing people experimenting with totally different platforms I've never heard of rather than the well-known ones.  

Thanks [Manton](https://manton.org) for organizing another IndiewebCamp!
