I am at the Indieweb Summit in Portland.  I have started using jekyll since there is now a nice [indieweb version](https://github.com/miklb/jekyll-indieweb).  Michael Bishop, the project maintainer, [posted](https://miklb.com/indieweb-summit-2016) that he will be participating remotely so I'm looking forward to any improvements.
