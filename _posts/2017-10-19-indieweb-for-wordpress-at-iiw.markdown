At [IIW 25](http://iiw.idcommons.net/IIW_25_Session_Notes), I hosted an Indieweb session and we went through an [Indieweb Wordpress Installation](https://indieweb.org/Getting_Started_on_WordPress).  We installed the [Indieweb Plugin for Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/indieweb/) and it guided us through installing plugins for [Webmention](https://wordpress.org/plugins/webmention/) and [Post Kinds](https://wordpress.org/plugins/indieweb-post-kinds/), for instance.  [Doc Searls](https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/) posted [Digging Indieweb](http://customercommons.org/2017/10/19/digging-indieweb/) on [Customer Commons](http://customercommons.org/) and we tested webmention and learned that under Settings/Discussion, there is a "Attempt to notify any blogs linked to from the article" setting that needs to be on.  Thanks to [David Shanske](https://david.shanske.com/) for the pointer.  David created a [new github issue](https://github.com/pfefferle/wordpress-webmention/issues/156) to make it more obvious from the user interface during installation.  I gave the issue a thumbs up!
