I enjoyed the first [Homebrew Website Club meeting in Austin](https://indieweb.org/Homebrew_Website_Club#Austin).  Although not neccessarily indieweb related, I learned about [Siteleaf](https://www.siteleaf.com/) which provides a nice web user interface for using the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) cms.  

A cool example use of [micro.blog](https://micro.blog) is updating fitness progress like [ryanruns.com](http://www.ryanruns.com/).  Manton showed off micro.blog's Indieweb support which was really cool to see.  Monkey Nest was a good venue for a meeting but might be too far from downtown.  There was interest expressed in having an HWC once every four weeks.  Thanks to [Manton](https://manton.org/) for finding a good meeting room on short notice and the great Indieweb sign.
