Thanks to [EFF-Austin](https://effaustin.org) for the opportunity to talk along with [Jon Lebkowsky](https://www.weblogsky.com) about the relationship between [Indieweb](https://indieweb.org) and the [Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse). ([Slides](https://herestomwiththeweather.com/effaustin/indieweb_mastodon) and [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRu3i9u9I5Q))

The meetup [Indieweb and Mastodon: The Time is Now](https://www.meetup.com/EFF-Austin/events/nltdcrydcqbrb/) was coincidentally in the same room as [IndieWebCamp Austin 2020](https://indieweb.org/2020/Austin).
