So much sadness yesterday with the passing of [Bernard Lietaer](http://www.lietaer.com/) but there must be a German word for the joy of sharing experiences about meeting Bernard.  

He was unique in his intelligence and kindness and just the mention of his name can light up a room.  I was lucky to meet him at a [weekend at Naropa](https://web.archive.org/web/20060526151856/http://www.naropa.edu/marpa/intentionaleconomics.html) and I am grateful for his generosity.
