I have been playing around with [Firefox Hello](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/where-firefox-hello-button) today. It requires at least version 34.0.5 of Firefox. I like having a contact list in my Firefox browser to initiate WebRTC video conferences. For instance, If I am signed in to Firefox Hello, you can easily call me after adding my email as a contact. If I am not signed in, it seems you have to send me an invitation url to call me which isnâ€™t so bad.
