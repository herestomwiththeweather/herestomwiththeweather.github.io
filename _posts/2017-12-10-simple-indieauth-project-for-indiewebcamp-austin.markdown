As expected, [IndieWebCamp Austin](https://2017.indieweb.org/austin) was great!  Demo time begins in a few minutes and I decided to add [IndieAuth](https://indieauth.net) authentication to a test project I already had on Github named [example_rails51_vuejs](https://github.com/herestomwiththeweather/example_rails51_vuejs).  I followed the [Indieauth for Developers](https://indieauth.com/developers) instructions and deployed the updated project to [https://austin-indieauth-demo.herokuapp.com](https://austin-indieauth-demo.herokuapp.com)
