I'm really looking forward to IndiewebCamp Austin.  Something we didn't have last time was [indieweb readers](https://indieweb.org/reader).  I have been using three of them and they all are fantastic.  It is easy to switch among them because your subscribed feeds are maintained on a different server that each of the readers can point to.  Here is [Aaron Parecki](https://aaronparecki.com/) introducing some of the new social readers at last year's Indieweb Summit.

Saturday is open space sessions which will include introductory ones for people just getting started and Sunday is projects.  There is still time to [register for IndiewebCamp Austin](https://2019.indieweb.org/austin).
