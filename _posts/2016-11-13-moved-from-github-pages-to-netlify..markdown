After spending the last 7 weeks on Github Pages, I was glad to hear via a retweet from [Jim Pick](https://jimpick.com) that [netlify](https://www.netlify.com) supports ssl for custom domains.  As the netlify site is very user friendly, it was easy to switch.  Now that ssl is working again, I'm curious about checking out [private webmentions](https://aaronparecki.com/2016/09/30/12/private-webmentions).
