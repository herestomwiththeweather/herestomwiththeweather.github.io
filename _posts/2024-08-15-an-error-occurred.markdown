Classical pianist [Jayson Gillham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Gillham) was pulled from an upcoming performance in Melbourne after dedicating a piece of music to the [journalists of Gaza](https://cpj.org/2024/08/journalist-casualties-in-the-israel-gaza-conflict/).  The Melbourne Symphony Orchestra [now says the cancellation was due to an error](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-08-15/mso-concert-backdown-jayson-gillham-gaza/104227894) and they appear to be rescheduling the concert.
