Tomorrow (Wed. 10/4) is [Austin's 2nd Homebrew Website Club](https://indieweb.org/Homebrew_Website_Club#Austin) meeting.  It is at the Monkey Nest coffee shop from 6:30-7:30pm.  Since last month's meeting, there has been some interest expressed for an [IndiewebCamp Austin](https://indieweb.org/2017/Austin) for the weekend of Dec 9.

Also, [Douglas Rushkoff](http://teamhuman.fm/episodes/ep-55-jon-lebkowsky/) was in Austin recently and [interviewed Jon Lebkowsky for his Team Human podcast](http://teamhuman.fm/episodes/ep-55-jon-lebkowsky/).  About 30 minutes in, the [Indieweb](https://indieweb.org) is mentioned.
