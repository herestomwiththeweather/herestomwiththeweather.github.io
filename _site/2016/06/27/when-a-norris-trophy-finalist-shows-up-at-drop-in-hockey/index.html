<p>Drop-in hockey is always a lot of fun but today it was crazy because seemingly out of nowhere, this player who looks like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brent_Burns">Brent Burns</a> shows up at the last minute.  After watching him skate for a few seconds, it was clear that this was the real deal.</p>

<p>Shortly into my first shift, someone on the other team hit the puck into center ice and I had the opportunity to retrieve it.  I saw Burns was the closest opposing player to the puck and yet somehow the thought “I got this” actually went through my head.  Since I had my back to the puck, I circled around but by the time I made eye-contact with the puck, Burns was already on his way to an easy score.</p>

<p>He was genuinely friendly afterwards and even said thanks for having him there (any time!) and several of us took a picture with him.  He <a href="https://twitter.com/Burnzie88/status/747572135267184640">tweeted</a> about the visit.</p>
