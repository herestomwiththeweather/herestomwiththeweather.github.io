		<p>Yesterday, Democracy Now! <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2015/3/13/data_and_goliath_bruce_schneier_on">interviewed Bruce Schneier</a> for his book <a href="https://www.schneier.com/book-dg.html">Data and Goliath</a>. The book includes a footnote to the informative <a href="http://confabulator.blogspot.com/2012/11/analysis-of-brightest-flashlight-free.html">Analysis of Brightest Flashlight Free for Android</a> in his “Business of Surveillance” chapter. Schneier notes that “the app started collecting and sending location information even before people clicked” accept on the license agreement. The FTC “didn’t fine the company, though, because the app was free.” More than 50 million users have downloaded the malware on the various app stores.</p>

<p>What is appalling is how often media coverage completely misunderstands the concept of consent with cases like this, Superfish and the Facebook Experiment. A typical example is <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/03/android-flashlight-apps-permissions-privacy">this Guardian article</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are users bothered by the privacy implications of these kinds of apps? Seemingly not, judging by their popularity. Brightest Flashlight has been installed more than 50m times according to the Google Play store’s stats.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The whole point is that these companies are not disclosing to the users what they are doing to them. And so it’s the users’ fault that they’re not bothered by the transgressions?</p>

		<p>I have been playing around with <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/where-firefox-hello-button">Firefox Hello</a> today. It requires at least version 34.0.5 of Firefox. I like having a contact list in my Firefox browser to initiate WebRTC video conferences. For instance, If I am signed in to Firefox Hello, you can easily call me after adding my email as a contact. If I am not signed in, it seems you have to send me an invitation url to call me which isn’t so bad.</p>

<p>I’m in Longview for my brother David’s memorial service. On a visit with him here in August, he showed me an online community devoted to sharing information about cancer treatment. It was a real online community that made a difference and I was very glad to see the important contributions he made.</p>

		<p>Thanks to Stephen Torrence for <a href="http://effaustin.org/2014/07/21st-century-virtual-identity-a-recording">recording the EFF-Austin meeting</a>. Some of the toughest questions raised after the presentation regarded digital death and Stephen <a href="https://soundcloud.com/stephen-torrence/eff-austin-july-meetup-2014">included some relevant links</a> with the recording. Lots to think about!</p>
