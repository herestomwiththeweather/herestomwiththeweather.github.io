# Jekyll-IndieWeb

Welcome to Jekyll-Indieweb. The goal of this project was to provide someone without a web presence a quick and easy way to start using the basics of the [Indieweb](https://indiewebcamp.com).

## Motivation

I've followed along a few[ IndieWeb Camps](https://indiewebcamp.com/IWC) and observed a few people new to both the indieweb as well as having their own web presence. I wanted to provide another option for those users to have a fairly simple method to easily get up and going with with a web site ready for indieweb and be able to dive in.
